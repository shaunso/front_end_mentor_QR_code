## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my second time attempting this challenge. First time I attempted this challenge, I had just completed the HTML5 & CSS3 courses on `https://www.w3schools.com/` and had not begun learning JavaScript.

This second attempt also acts as a benchmark for my understanding of  HTML5 & CSS3 as I was able to complete this challenge in circa. 2 hours.

I was able to complete this challenge with only needing to look up (i) semantic HTML5 and (ii) the 'background-image' CSS3 property.

This second attempt further bolsters my confidence in my journey as it is proof of my understanding of Web Development fundamentals.

### Continued development

Using CSS variables
